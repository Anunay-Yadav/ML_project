Abstract
============
*This particular work aims to analyze a very importantsubject - adoptability of pets.  The paper uses PetFinder.myAdoption  Prediction  dataset  on  Kaggle  for  analysis  andtries  to  incorporate  different  modalities  to  predict  speedof adoption.  Extensive data analysis is used to figure outfavourable  traits  in  pets  since  knowing  beforehand  thecharacteristics  of  adoptable  dogs  may  help  shape  shelterpolicy. The paper also discusses different feature extractiontechniques  for  different  modalities  and  compares  variousmodels to obtain the best results
